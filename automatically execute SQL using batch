How to automatically execute SQL queries with a batch file


OSQL UTILITY
The osql utility allows you to enter Transact-SQL statements, system procedures, and script files.  This utility uses ODBC to communicate with the server.  Once you have the osql command written, save the entire line into a file with a .bat extension.

Commonly Used Arguments:

-S (SQL Server\Instance name) Ex. -S myserver\SQLEXPRESS

-E (Uses a trusted connection instead of requesting a password)

-U (Login ID)

-P (Password)

-i (Input file) Ex. -i "c:\My Folder\MyScript.sql"

-o (Output file) Ex. -o "c:\My Folder\MyScriptLog.txt"

Example Syntax Usage:

osql -S .\sqlexpress -E  -i "c:\defragIndexes.sql" -o "c:\defragIndexesLog.txt"
(This command would execute a SQL script on a local SQLExpress server using Windows Authentication)

osql -S mysql -U sqluser -P sqlpassword  -i "c:\defragIndexes.sql" -o "c:\defragIndexesLog.txt"
(This command would execute a SQL script on a SQL server using SQL authentication)

EXECUTING THE BATCH FILE
Once you have your batch file created with the "osql" command, you can use Windows Scheduled Tasks to automatically run this script.

Open Control Panel=>Scheduled Tasks=>Add a Scheduled Task
Browse to the batch file (Ex. c:\MyScripts\myscript.sql)
Choose how often to run the task
Choose the time to run the task
Enter the Windows User account credentials
